# Resume Bullet Points

## 1. NU Rover - Northeastern University Mars Rover Design Team
**Fall 2025 - Present**

• Developed GNSS Mux ROS node enabling seamless switching between mock and real rover pose data, streamlining testing workflows and eliminating manual topic management for autonomous navigation systems

• Designed and implemented Camera Waypoints node using pinhole camera projection and TF transforms, allowing operators to place navigation waypoints directly from camera streams and eliminating error-prone manual correlation with satellite imagery

• Created global elevation costmap system using USGS DEM data and QGIS processing, enabling long-range autonomous path planning with slope-based traversability encoding (0-100 cost range) for optimal route selection across 1km² competition terrain

## 2. Evaluation of Modern SLAM Methods with Spot
**Fall 2025 - Northeastern EECE 5554: Sensing and Navigation**

• Evaluated five state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms (ORB-SLAM, LOAM-SLAM, Kiss-ICP, RTAB-Map, OctoMap) using real-world sensor data collected from Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot

• Collected and processed multi-modal sensor data including LiDAR, IMU, and camera feeds to benchmark SLAM performance across diverse indoor and outdoor environments

• Analyzed mapping accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness of each method to provide comparative performance metrics for autonomous navigation applications

## 3. Certifiable Robot-World Hand-Eye Calibration
**Fall 2025 - Northeastern EECE 5550: Mobile Robotics**

• Extended certifiably correct algorithm for generalized robot-world and hand-eye calibration (RWHEC) by implementing data processing, synchronization, and visualization pipelines for multi-sensor robotic platforms

• Developed automated calibration workflows integrating AprilTag detection, trajectory recording, and transform optimization to achieve certifiable calibration accuracy for complex sensor configurations

• Created visualization tools for trajectory analysis and calibration validation, enabling real-time assessment of calibration quality and sensor frame alignment accuracy
