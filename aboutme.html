								<h2>Undergraduate Experience</h2>
								<!-- <p>I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Kansas, graduating in Spring 2024. My undergraduate studies provided a strong foundation in mechanical design, control systems, and mechatronics. The program emphasized hands-on learning and interdisciplinary collaboration, which prepared me well for complex engineering challenges. During my time at KU, I served as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for ME 306: Science of Materials, where I prepared problem sets and guided students through course material. I also worked as a Robotics Undergraduate Research Assistant from September 2023 to May 2024, developing an autonomous ground vehicle using ROS and implementing SLAM with a stereo camera for simultaneous localization and mapping. My capstone project, developing an animatronic Jayhawk mascot suit, allowed me to integrate computer vision, mechanical systems, and real-time control—skills that directly translate to my current work in robotics. The project taught me the importance of systems thinking and working across mechanical, electrical, and software domains to create cohesive robotic systems.</p> -->

								<h2>Master's Program</h2>
								<!-- <p>Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Robotics at Northeastern University, I'm diving deep into autonomous systems, computer vision, SLAM, and mobile robotics. The program has been transformative, exposing me to cutting-edge research and real-world applications. Through coursework in Sensing and Navigation, I've evaluated state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms on platforms like Boston Dynamics Spot, gaining hands-on experience with sensor fusion and localization. In Mobile Robotics, I've worked on certifiable calibration methods for multi-sensor systems, ensuring reliable autonomous operation. The program's emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation has strengthened my ability to bridge the gap between research and real-world deployment. My involvement with NU Rover has been particularly valuable, allowing me to apply classroom knowledge to a competitive Mars rover project while contributing to a team working toward the 2026 University Rover Challenge.</p> -->

								<h2>Internship Experience</h2>
								<!-- <p>My internship experiences have provided diverse exposure to both mechanical design and robotics applications across different industries. At Tesla, I worked as a Design Engineering Intern on the Model S/X Interiors Team from May to August 2023, where I redesigned the Model X trunk floor with an innovative magnetic upright holding mechanism. I built functional prototypes, prepared CAD models in CATIA, and presented project progress to upper management. One of my key achievements was achieving $107k in cost savings by initiating the rework of an obsolete part for reintroduction into production. This experience taught me the importance of cost-conscious design, supplier coordination, and presenting technical work to leadership.</p>

								<p>Prior to Tesla, I interned at Spirit AeroSystems from May to August 2022, where I collaborated with design team leads to improve composite part designs that had failed fire tests. This experience introduced me to aerospace design constraints and the importance of rigorous testing and iteration in engineering design.</p>

								<p>In the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work as a Reinforcement Learning Research Assistant at Graz University of Technology in Austria. There, I taught a reinforcement learning agent to autonomously navigate a custom 2D maze environment with continuous state space, further developing my skills in machine learning and autonomous systems. This international research experience broadened my perspective on robotics research and exposed me to different approaches in the field.</p>

								<p>Most recently, from September 2024 to June 2025, I worked as a Project Lead for Avik Services, an Amazon contractor, where I collaborated with Amazon's Project Kuiper Ground Support Equipment team. I led a group of four workers and served as a liaison between Amazon and Avik teams throughout long-term hardware installation projects for a new satellite manufacturing facility. This role developed my project management skills and gave me experience working in a fast-paced, large-scale manufacturing environment.</p> -->

								<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
								<!-- <p>My interests span autonomous mobile robotics, particularly Mars exploration rovers and outdoor navigation systems. I'm fascinated by SLAM and localization challenges, especially in featureless environments like desert terrain. Human-robot interaction and animatronics represent another area of passion, where I can combine mechanical design with intelligent control systems. I'm also drawn to machine learning applications in robotics, particularly reinforcement learning for autonomous navigation, sensor calibration methods, and path planning algorithms that enable robust autonomous operation.</p> -->
